# Salary Calculator by Joey Heintz

## Description

I made a calculator that collects user input of an employee from the DOM and calculates the salary info to create a total monthly value that displays on the DOM. I created an input form in HTML to collect the info and store it to an object in an array. From there I created and HTML table and appended that data to it. I then targeted the salary values of each submitted employee and added that to itself divided by 12 and added that to the footer as a total monthly value of all employees. After that I added a function to delete the output of an employee's info from the DOM and their monthly salary amount from the monthly total. Finally I added stylings to be added if the monthly total reached a total over 20,000. During the process, I also added stylings to the page to make it more appealing.

## Usage

A user inputs the values into the input fields and hits submit. The DOM will then output the information and the total monthly salary expense. If the total monthly value is higher than 20,000 the user can delete the employee info and it will subtract their monthly salary from the total.
